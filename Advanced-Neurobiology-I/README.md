## üß≠ Course Overview

This course provides a deep exploration of the **molecular and cellular basis of neuroscience**, focusing on how the nervous system can function under both normal and pathological conditions. Topics are ranged from basic neuroanatomy and neuronal morphology to important topics as example **electrical signaling, neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity and neurological diseases** such as Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs and prion disorders.
The course integrates **molecular biology**, **electrophysiology**, and **neurodegenerative disease research**, linking a fundamental neuroscience concepts with biomedical and clinical applications.

## üß† Relevance to My Field

As a Master of Science Student specializing in **Biochemistry and Molecular Biology** focusing on **Molecular Cancer Biology and Bioinformatics**, this course has strengthened my knowledge of **molecular neuroscience**, which is very crucial for bridging **cancer biology and neurobiology** research. Its importance lies in:

* Understanding of **neuronal signaling pathways** that overlap with **cancer signaling** (as example, ion channels, synaptic plasticity and growth factor signaling).
* Exploring **neurodegenerative diseases** (Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs, prion disorders) that share common mechanisms with **oncogenic processes** such as protein aggregation, misfolding and abnormal signal transduction.
* Gaining insight into **Ca¬≤‚Å∫-dependent signaling and neurotransmitter release**, which parallels **calcium signaling in cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis**.
* Learning modern **neuroscience techniques** ( as example, patch clamp, imaging, genetic perturbation), relevant for both **cancer neuroscience** and systems biology approaches.
* Building an integrative perspective at the intersection of **cancer neuroscience, and bioinformatics**, essential for emerging fields like **cancer neuroscience**.
