## üß≠ Course Overview

**Advanced Neurobiology II** extends the course of **Advanced Neurobiology I**, focusing on sensory perception, movement, mood regulation and gene-behavior relationships.
It integrates **molecular, cellular and circuit-level neuroscience**, emphasizing both **healthy and pathological states**, including movement disorders, mood disorders and behavioral genetics.

Key areas include:

* **Sensory systems**: such as vision, auditory, chemosensory, touch and pain
* **Movement and motor disorders**: basal ganglia, dopamine system and diseases as example**Alzheimer‚Äôs disease(AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS), Huntington‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs**
* **Mood and psychiatric disorders**: autism, addiction, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar, attention disorder
* **Behavioral genetics**: circadian rhythms, sex-dependent behaviors, parabiosis and leptin signaling

## üß† Relevance to My Field

As a Master of Science Student in **Biochemistry and Molecular Biology**, focusing on **Molecular Cancer Biology and Bioinformatics**, this essential course has:

* Enhanced my understanding of **neuronal signaling and sensory pathways**, which is very  essential for overlap with **cancer signaling and calcium-mediated pathways**.
* Provided insight into **neurodegenerative and movement disorders**, sharing mechanisms with **oncogenic protein aggregation, misfolding, and cellular stress**.
* Explored **molecular and genetic bases of behavior**, offering parallels with the **genomic and transcriptomic analysis in cancer research**.
* Taught advanced **neuroscience techniques** (as example,optogenetics, electrophysiology, imaging, genetic perturbation), which is very useful for experimental design in **cancer neuroscience**.
* Strengthened a **multidisciplinary approach** connecting molecular neuroscience, behavior and bioinformatics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Acquired

* Understanding of **sensory perception, motor control, and behavior** at molecular, cellular and circuit levels.
* Knowledge about **movement and psychiatric disorders** mechanisms.
* Competence in **gene-behavior relationships** and circadian biology.
* Familiarity with **experimental neuroscience methods**: electrophysiology, imaging, animal models, genetic manipulation.
* Ability to link **cellular signaling and behavioral outputs** to broader the biomedical contexts.
* Broadened **cross-disciplinary perspective** bridging many important fields like neuroscience, genetics and bioinformatics.
