## üß≠ Course Overview

Medical Neuroscience is a medical-school level course that provides a comprehensive introduction to **human neurobiology**, focusing on the functional organization and physiology of the **central nervous system (CNS)**. It examines how the brain and spinal cord mediate **sensation, movement, memory, cognition and emotion**, while establishing a framework for understanding impairments caused by **disease, injury or dysfunction** of the CNS.

The course is adapted from the **Duke University School of Medicine**, maintaining medical-level rigor and scope, though without on-campus experiences such as **brain dissections**.

The content is structured into six main topics, which are further divided into 18 modules:

1. **Neuroanatomy** ‚Äì Surface and internal anatomy of the human brain and the organization of both sensory and motor systems.
2. **Neural Signaling** ‚Äì Mechanisms of neuronal excitability, action potential generation, synaptic transmission and neural plasticity.
3. **Sensory Systems** ‚Äì Organization and function of somatosensory, proprioceptive, visual, auditory, and balance systems.
4. **Motor Systems** ‚Äì Brain and spinal mechanisms that govern voluntary and involuntary movement.
5. **Brain Development** ‚Äì Neurobiological mechanisms of nervous system development and changes across the lifespan.
6. **Cognition** ‚Äì Association systems of the cerebral hemispheres, cortical networks for integrating perception, memory, and emotion, as well as regulation of brain state and homeostasis.

The ultimate goal(purpose)of this course is to provide a **solid medical foundation** for linking neural structure to function and for understanding how neurological disorders can affect sensation, action and cognition.

## üß† Relevance to My Field

As a **Master‚Äôs student in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (Cancer Biology & Bioinformatics)**, this course builds a medical-level understanding of the nervous system, which is highly relevant for:

* Bridging the gap between **molecular neuroscience** with **cancer biology** and **neuro-oncology**.
* Exploring overlaps between **neuronal signaling** and **oncogenic signaling** (as example, ion channels, synaptic plasticity and growth factor signaling pathways).
* Understanding **neurodegenerative disease pathology** (Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs, prion diseases) and parallels to cancer (protein misfolding, aggregation, abnormal signaling).
* Linking **developmental neuroscience** with **cancer development and epigenetics**.
* Learning advanced techniques and concepts applicable to both **clinical neuroscience** and **systems biology** approaches.
