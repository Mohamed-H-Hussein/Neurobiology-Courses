# 🧠 Neurobiology Courses Repository

Welcome to the **Neurobiology Courses** repository!
This repository contains my personal summaries and reflective notes from advanced neurobiology courses I completed independently alongside my Master of Science studies in **Biochemistry and Molecular Biology**. These courses were selected carefully to strengthen my understanding of the **neuroscience at molecular, cellular and systems levels**, complementing my current research in **Molecular Cancer Biology and Bioinformatics**.

## 📖 About These Courses

During my Master of Science studies in **Biochemistry and Molecular Biology**, I focused on **Molecular Cancer Biology** and **Bioinformatics**. These advanced neurobiology courses were chosen to broaden my understanding of neuronal signaling, sensory systems and neurodegenerative mechanisms. They were very essential for connecting molecular neuroscience concepts with cancer research and bioinformatics analysis.
